CAD files that were used for materials in the sequencing workshop.

So far, there's only the practice flow cell that we designed to give people some idea of what the fluid dynamics feel like.
It used a sandwich design that is cut from clear 1.5mm acryclic and then glued together.
The rationale for making these practice flow cells is that priming and loading the flow cells is a bit tricky, and getting this wrong may damage the flow cell and lead to poor sequencing performance.
So we thought it would be nice to have something to practice on. The practice flow cells do not exactly duplicate the fluid dynamics of an actual flow cell, but they have proven sufficient to give people a few "A-ha!" moments.
