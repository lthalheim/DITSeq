# DITSeq - Sequencing to the people!

With the appearance of Oxford Nanopore's handheld DNA sequencer, the MinION, hands-on DNA sequencing has come within reach of amateur and citizen scientists. However, some barriers remain to actually put this technology into the hands of the interested amateur. This project aims to spread hands-on experience with DNA sequencing and to remove some of these remaining barriers by

* Designing and building auxiliary open hardware lab equipment
* Gathering and publishing information in the public domain on the most cost-effective auxiliary reagents
* Creating a public domain "How to" guide for citizen scientists on DNA sequencing
* Jump-starting a decentralized, citizen-driven monitoring of Antibiotic Resistance markers in the general population

This repository serves to collect all materials, code, documentation etc. that come out of this project.
